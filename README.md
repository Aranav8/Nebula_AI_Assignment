The user interface for the Multimodal Code Debug Assistant is a full-stack developer tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide intelligent debugging suggestions based on code, logs, and screenshot analysis.

### 2. Multimodal Bug Submission

Once logged in, the user is presented with the main dashboard. Here, they can provide a complete picture of their bug by inputting:
- A title for the session.
- The problematic code snippet in a rich editor.
- The full error trace or console output.
- Any relevant logs.
- A screenshot of the UI to provide visual context (optional).

### 3. AI-Powered Solution

After submitting the context, the backend processes all the information and returns a structured suggestion from the Google Gemini AI. The UI then neatly displays:
- **The Rationale:** A clear, step-by-step explanation of what the bug is and why it occurred.
- **The Corrected Code:** A ready-to-use code block with the fix applied, displayed in a read-only editor.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get the frontend running locally, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher) installed.
- **The [backend server](https://github.com/Aranav8/Nebula_AI_Assignment_Backend) must be running first.** The frontend cannot function without it.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Aranav8/Nebula_AI_Assignment
    cd Nebula_AI_Assignment
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure environment variables:**
    
    The frontend needs to know the address of the backend API. Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project folder. The default value is set up to work with the backend running on port 5001.
    
    ```env
    # ./.env
    REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5001/api
    ```

4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The application will open automatically in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
